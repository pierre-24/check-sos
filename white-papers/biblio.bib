These parameters are derivable from experiment or from theory. The valence-bond charge-transfer model provides a clear physical picture for the dependence of the hyperpolarizabilities on the structure of charge-transfer molecules and leads to good agreement with the trends predicted by the AM1 calculations.},

We show that correlations between (hyper)polarizabilities and this parameter reproduce remarkably well semi-empirical predictions. We extend this model in order to account for the solvent reaction field. This model helps in the understanding of the dependencies of (hyper)polarizabilities on solvent polarity.},
